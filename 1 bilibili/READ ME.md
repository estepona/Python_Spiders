### For practice
### both spiders should work and deliver the same results

#### Updates:
- 3/15/2017: uploaded sample output csv file; added a solution of opening output files to Mac users  
- 3/14/2017: \_clean completed; planning on "run_all.py"
- 3/13/2017: \_explore completed; working on \_clean

#### This spider aims to find all important statistics about all videos of a given user: 
- input: user's mid
- output: a csv file that contains the following information:
	- aid
	- title
	- url
	- date
	- time
	- length
	- play
	- danmaku (a number)
	- review
	- favorites
	- coin

#### Two spiders:
- \_explore: for explore and practice. all errors were saved as a reminder. 
- \_clean: organized file. I try to put everything into functions.

#### Output file:
['stat_16693558_2017-03-14_20'45'58.csv'](https://github.com/estepona/Python_Spiders/blob/master/1%20bilibili/stat_16693558_2017-03-14_20'45'58.csv) is a sample output file.
