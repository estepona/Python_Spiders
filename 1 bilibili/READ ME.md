### For practice
### both spiders should work and deliver the same resuls

Updates:
- 3/14/2017: _explore complete, working on _clean

This spider aims to find all important statistics about all videos of a given user. 
- input: user's mid
- output: a csv file that contains the following information:
	- aid
	- title
	- url
	- date
	- time
	- length
	- play
	- danmaku (a number)
	- review
	- favorites
	- coin

Two spiders:
- _explore: for explore and practice. all errors were saved as a reminder. 
- _clean: organized file. I try to put everything into functions.
